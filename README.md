## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to building modern, scalable design systems using React, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. This space reflects my ongoing work in creating reusable UI components, consistent styling patterns, and accessible design foundations that support rapid front-end development.

As a React developer, Iâ€™m focused on improving UI architecture by developing design systems that balance flexibility with structure. With Tailwind CSS, I can maintain consistency and clarity in styling, while Radix UI provides a solid foundation of accessible, unstyled components that can be fully customized to match any design language.

This repository includes a growing collection of components and utilitiesâ€”built with reusability and scalability in mind. From buttons, modals, and tooltips to more complex patterns like dialogs, tabs, and dropdown menus, each component is designed with composability, accessibility, and developer experience at its core. I follow a utility-first approach for styling with Tailwind, ensuring clean markup and easy customization without sacrificing design cohesion.

Alongside code, youâ€™ll find structured documentation, usage examples, and insights into how the components integrate into larger design systems or app architectures. I also explore common design system challenges such as theming, responsive variants, accessibility, and managing tokens.

This repository is a living, evolving systemâ€”ideal for teams or solo developers looking to speed up UI development while keeping design quality high. Whether youâ€™re building your own design system or looking for ideas on how to combine Tailwind and Radix UI effectively, I hope this work provides inspiration and practical value.

Feedback, suggestions, and contributions are always welcome as I continue refining and expanding this system for real-world use.
